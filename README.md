# Snake Game

## Description
This project is a recreation of the classic Snake game, developed using Processing.

Players control a snake that moves around the screen, growing longer each time it eats food.

The objective is to navigate the snake without crashing into the walls or its own body.

The game features basic mechanics, including movement, collision detection, and scoring.

It also includes a start screen and a game over screen with the final score.

This project demonstrates the implementation of classic game logic and design in a simple, yet engaging way.
